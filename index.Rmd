```

# Some questions to ponder

## What proportion of findings in the published scientific literature (in the fields you care about) are *actually true*?

---

- 100%
- 90%
- 70%
- 50%
- 30%

## How do we define what "*actually true*" means?

## Is there a reproducibility crisis in science?

---

>- Yes, a significant crisis
>- Yes, a slight crisis
>- No crisis
>- Don't know

```

## But wait! Do we agree on what the terms mean?

> "**Replication** refers to testing the reliability of a prior finding with different data. **Robustness** refers to testing the reliability of a prior finding using the same data and a different analysis strategy. **Reproducibility** refers to testing the reliability of a prior finding using the same data and the same analysis strategy (Natl. Acad. Sci. Eng. Med. 2019). Each of the three notions plays an important role in assessing credibility."

<small>[[@Nosek2022-hv]](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-020821-114157)</small>

## *Methods* reproducibility

- Enough details about materials & methods recorded (& reported)
- Same results with same materials & methods

<small>[[@goodman_what_2016]](http://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5027)</small>

---

> "In principle, all reported evidence should be reproducible. If someone applies the same analysis to the same data, the same result should occur. Reproducibility tests can fail for two reasons. A **process reproducibility failure** occurs when the original analysis cannot be repeated because of the unavailability of data, code, information needed to recreate the code, or necessary software or tools."

<small>[[@Nosek2022-hv]](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-020821-114157)</small>

```

## *Results* reproducibility 

- Same results from independent study

<small>[[@goodman_what_2016]](http://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5027)</small>

---

> "...An **outcome reproducibility failure** occurs when the reanalysis obtains a different result than the one reported originally. This can occur because of an error in either the original or the reproduction study."

<small>[[@Nosek2022-hv]](https://doi.org/10.1146/annurev-psych-020821-114157)</small>

## *Inferential* reproducibility

- Same inferences from one or more studies or reanalyses

<small>[[@goodman_what_2016]](http://doi.org/10.1126/scitranslmed.aaf5027)</small>

## The implicit ethos of science

---

> "I’m talking about a specific, extra type of integrity that is not lying, but bending over backwards to show how you’re maybe wrong, that you ought to do when acting as a scientist. And this is our responsibility as scientists, certainly to other scientists, and I think to laymen."

<small>[[@Feynman1974-ld]](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm)</small>

---

> "The first principle is that *you must not fool yourself—and you are the easiest person to fool*.  So you have to be very careful about that.  After you’ve not fooled yourself, it’s easy not to fool other scientists.  You just have to be honest in a conventional way after that."

<small>[[@Feynman1974-ld]](https://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm)</small>

## [Robert Merton](https://www.amazon.com/Sociology-Science-Theoretical-Empirical-Investigations/dp/0226520927) and scientific norms

- **universalism**: scientific validity is independent of sociopolitical status/personal attributes of its participants
- **communalism**: common ownership of scientific goods (intellectual property)
- **disinterestedness**: scientific institutions benefit a common scientific enterprise, not specific individuals
- **organized skepticism**: claims should be exposed to critical scrutiny before being accepted

<small>[[@Merton1979-le]](https://www.amazon.com/Sociology-Science-Theoretical-Empirical-Investigations/dp/0226520927)</small>

## Are these norms at-risk?

---

```{r}

```

---

> "*...psychologists tend to treat other peoples’ theories like toothbrushes; no self-respecting individual wants to use anyone else’s.*"

<small>[[@Mischel2011-br]](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/becoming-a-cumulative-science)</small>

---

> "*The toothbrush culture undermines the building of a genuinely cumulative science, encouraging more parallel play and solo game playing, rather than building on each other’s directly relevant best work.*"

<small>[[@Mischel2011-br]](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/becoming-a-cumulative-science)</small>

# Practical Solutions [[@Gilmore2018-cb]](https://doi.org/10.1177/2515245917746500)

## Some recommendations

- Build upon existing (secondary) data and collect (much) larger samples
- Share protocols and complete methods (use video)
- Share data (*FAIR*ly)
- Script analyses and share analysis code
- Preregister data analyses
- Use version control

## What to share

- Data
- Analysis code
- [Displays](https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/144), [materials](https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/248)
- Procedure manuals
    - https://play-behaviorome.github.io/KoBoToolbox/
    - https://play-behaviorome.github.io./protocol/
    - https://penn-state-open-science.github.io/survey-fall-2022/

## How to share

- With ethics board/IRB approval
- With participant permission

## Where to share data?

- Lab website vs.
- Supplemental information with journal article vs.
- Data repository

---

- [Open Science Framework (OSF)](http://osf.io)
- [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/)
- [Databrary](http://databrary.org)
- [OpenNeuro](http://openneuro.org)

## When to share

- Paper goes out for review or is published
    - Some journals in some fields require post-acceptance "verification"
- Grant ends
- ~~Never~~

## How do these suggestions impact your research?
    
# Tools for reproducible science

## What is version control and why use it?

- thesis_2019-01-15v02.docx
- thesis_2019-01-16v01.docx

## Version control systems

- Used in large-scale software engineering
- svn, bitbucket, git
- GitHub

## How I use GitHub

- Every project gets a repository
- Work locally, commit (save & increment version), push to GitHub
- Talks, classes, software, analyses, web sites

---

```{r, fig.cap="https://github.com/gilmore-lab"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/github-gilmorelab.jpg")
```

## FAIR data principles

Data should be...

- **F**indable
- **A**ccessible
- **I**nteroperable
- **R**eusable

[[@Wilkinson2016-qr]](https://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2016.18)

---

- Data in interoperable formats (.txt or .csv)
- Scripted, automated = minimize human-dependent steps.
- Well-documented
- Kind to your future (forgetful) self
- Transparent to me & colleagues == transparent to others

## Scripted analyses

- SPSS, SAS, R, Python
- [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
- [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) via RStudio

---

```
# Import/gather data

# Clean data

# Visualize data

# Analyze data

# Report findings
```

---

```
# Import data
my_data <- read.csv("path/2/data_file.csv")

# Clean data
my_data$gender <- tolower(my_data$gender) # make lower case
...
```

---

```
# Import data
source("R/Import_data.R") # source() runs scripts, loads functions

# Clean data
source("R/Clean_data.R")

# Visualize data
source("R/Visualize_data.R")
...
```

## But my SPSS syntax file already does this
    
- Great! How are you sharing these files?
- (And how much would SPSS cost you if you had to buy it yourself?)

## But I prefer {Python, Julia, Ruby, MATLAB, ...}

- Great! Let's talk about [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

## Reproducible research with [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

- Add-on package to R, developed by the RStudio team
- Combine text, code, images, video, equations into one document
- Render into PDF, MS Word, HTML (web page or site, slides, a blog, or even a book)

---

- [R Markdown documentation](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/); online [tutorial](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html); Mike Frank and Chris Hartgerink's [tutorial](https://libscie.github.io/rmarkdown-workshop/handout.html)
- Similar to Mathematica notebooks, [Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org)

---

```
x <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
hist(x)
```

---

```{r}
x <- rnorm(n = 100, mean = 0, sd = 1)
hist(x)
```

---

The mean is `r mean(x)`, the range is [`r min(x)`, `r max(x)`].

## Registered reports and pre-registration

---

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("https://cdn.cos.io/media/images/registered_reports.width-800.png")
```

<https://cos.io/rr/>

## Why preregister?

- Nosek: "Don't fool yourself" ("...and you are the easiest to fool" -- R. Feynmann)
- Separate *confirmatory* from *exploratory* analyses
- Confirmatory (hypothesis-driven): *p*-hacking matters
- Exploratory: *p*-values hard(er) to interpret

## How/where

- OSF: <http://help.osf.io/m/registrations/l/524205-register-your-project>

## Skeptics and converts

- Susan Goldin-Meadow (skeptic), ["Why pregistration makes me nervous"](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/why-preregistration-makes-me-nervous)
- Mike Frank (former skeptic, now advocate), ["Pregister everything"](http://babieslearninglanguage.blogspot.com/2016/07/preregister-everything.html)

- Preregistration can constrain the data analysis process, but...

---

> "*To investigate whether,in psychology, preregistration lives up to that potential, we focused on all articles published in Psychological Science with a preregistered badge between February 2015 and November 2017, and assessed the adherence to their corresponding preregistration plans. We observed deviations from the plan in all studies, and, more importantly, in all but one study, at least one of these deviations was not fully disclosed.*"
